# Pet Simulator

This is a simple pet simulator written in Python. It serves as a basic introduction to object-oriented programming. The code in the main branch is a simple implementation of the simulator and is meant to be a starting point for further development.

## Usage

Run the program with:

```sh
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to name your pet. After that, you can interact with your pet by feeding it or playing with it. The pet's hunger and happiness levels will change based on your actions.
